What the world needs now is a future-facing financial system for the digital age. At Fnality we have been speaking – and listening – to the real users of today’s financial systems. From businesses to banks there is a clear collective ambition for a simpler faster safer and more resilient payment system; one that can move and settle money quickly and efficiently with minimised risk and much more transparency. Fnality Global Payments We are building a new payment system that will enable tokenised peer-to-peer markets.  Fnality Global Payments (FnGP) will comprise a series of national systems each regulated in its home jurisdiction. We call each of these a Fnality Payment System (FnPS)  In each payment system a Fnality settlement asset will act as the settlement/payment asset for any Payment (P) Delivery v Payment (DvP) or payment vs. payment (PvP) need. FnGP are underpinned by Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT). The nature of DLT is such that it enables FnGP to:  Operate a true peer-to-peer market Allow for immediate settlement Interoperate across business platforms and jurisdictions The key benefits of the above are:  Reduced counter-party and credit risk  Reduced operational risk  Efficient liquidity management  An ability to move resources from risk mitigation to business growth How will we use the information about you?  We will use your personal information to process your application to enable us to assess your suitability for a role and for other legitimate business purposes such as improving our sites and talent management practices.

Solving impactful problems on Seesaw’s Engineering team feels different from any other place.

Wealthfront started with the ambition to transform the investment advisory business with the goal to unlock access to high quality investment advice for millions who were underserved by the traditional institutions. We built the first automated investment product that allows you to invest in a personalized portfolio of thousands of companies in seconds for a remarkably low fee; we then expanded into banking which made it remarkably easy for people to automate their finances end-to-end and eliminated the hassle of money management all of which resulted in attracting more than $50 billion of our client’s hard earned savings created the robo-advisor category and transformed the broader industry. And yet we have a long way to go to achieve our mission to build a financial system that favors people not institutions.

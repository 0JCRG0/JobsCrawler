Our Mission: To make recurring work fun fast and faultless for teams everywhere. Our culture: Process Street was founded on a strong belief in the work-life benefits of a healthy collaborative remote culture. We value flexibility because many of us are parents travelers or just creatives who arent inspired by the construct of a mundane 9-to-5. Spread across 9 different time zones we communicate asynchronously work autonomously and take real ownership of our work. We know human connections are what make teams strong so we regularly do coffee chats game-playing story-telling and more to build strong relationships.

You want agency. We practice the Shape Up process and run 6-week cycles and 2-week cooldowns. For the 6-week cycles PMs provide a problem statement and some guidelines – no tickets no detailed specs no high-fidelity solutions and no estimates. Designers and engineers are trusted to craft the best solution possible in the cycle using user research data experience and grit. During the 2-week cooldowns you have the autonomy to work on whats important to you – including code maintainability or making the team faster. If a lot of responsibility freedom and ambiguity sounds refreshing this role is for you. Youre well-versed in JavaScript and Scala (or Ruby/Java/C# or eager to learn it!). Process Street is built on Scala/Play 2 AngularJS React Redux Postgres Serverless and AWS. If youve built backend APIs and front-end React components youre an ideal candidate for this role.

You love process but loathe meetings bureaucracy and ceremony. We think process is a tool. Used well it makes us a better faster team. But when its not doing that we drop it. We avoid unnecessary meetings whenever possible. A typical week for our engineers and designers has fewer than 5 hours of meetings. You want to have a big impact. Were a small team and were still early stage. We dont have designated areas of responsibility and everyone wears the product hat. Every cycle brings new challenges and your sphere of influence is wide. You love the variety and dont want to be shackled to a single project for years. You have 5 or more years of experience in software development. We will hire in a range of levels for this position. So if the role excites you and you have 4 years of experience but dont have the exact title listed here you should apply.  Our Benefits  “No Meeting” Fridays! Unlimited PTO policy – Most take 3-4 weeks plus their major holidays AND a company-wide week off in December. Company offsite – We get together as a whole company to celebrate company milestones as well as encourage and sponsor small group meetups so that you can meet your teammates face-to-face around the world. Social time – We know human connections are what make teams strong. We regularly do coffee chats game-playing story-telling house tours (only if youre comfortable) and more to build connections. Generous health insurance – for US employees and their families including dental and vision plans. Equity for all full-time roles.  Confidence can sometimes hold us back from applying for a job. But well let you in on a secret: theres no such thing as a perfect candidate. Process Street is a place where everyone can grow. So however you identify and whatever background you bring with you please apply if this is a role that would make you excited to come into work every day.

Apprentice to Eccentric Millionaire. Become an Amazon Expert @ Fun Ecom Co | Great People & Flexible Hours,https://www.workingnomads.com/job/go/108552/,- Is learning new things like crack to you?- Do you get joy out of tweaking and optimizing things relentlessly?- Do you thrive in a high-stress environment filled with political infighting bureaucracy and corporate nonsense?&nbsp;If so then we are the place for you except you might hate how nice of a company we have - filled with happy generally competent people that don&rsquo;t put up with jerks. Frankly it makes me sick how nice everyone is.&nbsp; We are remote full time have very flexible hours people are judged by their output not by how much they suck up to the boss and turnover is super low because the company believes that happy employees = happy customers = happy bank account. Simply disgusting if you ask me.&nbsp;--Is this a real job ad?--Yup! Amazingly enough we actually paid money to post this on a bunch of different job sites. And it&rsquo;s not even a pyramid scheme! Plus get this: the owner just started paying our 60ish employees with money instead of Pizza Hut coupons - we&rsquo;re big time people.&nbsp;Our careers page is actually worth checking out to learn more about how insane we are (sidenote: it won a web design award in 1993 - we&rsquo;re a pretty big deal):&nbsp;http://www.jlstradingco.com/careers/ &nbsp;And check out our reviews on Google Glassdoor or Indeed to see that it&rsquo;s not just the founder&rsquo;s mother who says we&rsquo;re cool.&nbsp;--What do you guys do?--We sell a lot of different things but our primary focus now is developing/engineering from scratch very cool products in a variety of niches.&nbsp;&nbsp;A small sampling:&nbsp;- Bad Parking Cards (https://amz.ru5Eya) - Steak Weights (https://amz.ru6kin) - Beverage Barricades (https://amz.ru6kip) &nbsp;Our business is growing rapidly every year and it&rsquo;s our intention to continue that for as long as possible which means we need good people to help us keep up with the growth.&nbsp; --What is your company like?--1. Full Time Remote/Flexible Hours. You will be working from home in your pajamas on your schedule. And we don&rsquo;t care if you work 10 hour days 4 days a week or want to catch up on the weekend. So long as you get a lot of work done we&rsquo;re happy campers. &nbsp;2. Complete Work/Life Balance. If you&rsquo;re routinely working more than 45ish hours you&rsquo;re gonna get a friendly talking-to. We want you to be operating at 100% capacity which means that you need to rest.&nbsp;3. You Can Be Yourself. You don&rsquo;t have to put on a fake professional face. You can just be yourself. You can talk smack to the CEO and no one will think anything of it.&nbsp;4. Major Opportunities for Career Growth. We are not trying to just be a small business. We plan to be doing $100 million annually in the next few years. We promote quickly once we identify talent. It doesn&rsquo;t matter what your credentials are &ndash; it matters what you get done. &nbsp;5. Strongly Anti-BS. Anybody in the company can (and is expected to) tell the CEO when he is wrong. There are no bureaucratic or BS rules getting in the way of getting work done.&nbsp; 6. No Micro-Management. Once you&rsquo;re trained and have demonstrated you know your stuff we are pretty hands-off. In fact if you need external management to stay on-task and motivated we probably aren&rsquo;t the place for you.&nbsp;7. Supportive Environment. We don&rsquo;t operate via intense stress or unreasonable top-down deadlines. Everyone wants you to be successful &ndash; internal politics are at a minimum here.&nbsp;8. No Toxic People Allowed. We try very hard to screen out mean people before they get in but in case they slip through we fire them quickly. Imagine never having to interact with toxic people at work - how nice would that be?&nbsp;9. We&rsquo;ll Invest in Your Training. We want you and everyone to get better constantly. You&rsquo;ll be learning new things all the time and are strongly encouraged to invest time every day to learn new things improve your system/work process and just generally try to make your life easier.&nbsp;10. Four+ Weeks Vacation. We 100% want you to recharge so having plenty of time off is absolutely worth it.&nbsp;11. Self-Funded So We Can Do What&rsquo;s Right for Us. We don&rsquo;t have to answer to anyone but ourselves so we can make the right decision for the long-term health of the company vs trying to get big too fast or cut corners to appease some selfish investor.&nbsp;--What are your company&rsquo;s values?--See here: http://www.jlstradingco.com/careers/ &nbsp;Yes those are legitimately our values. The careers page is definitely worth checking out - it&rsquo;s not just normal corporate BS. We promise you&rsquo;ll learn a lot about us.&nbsp; --OK so I&rsquo;ve read like 8 dang pages about you guys. Will you tell me what the actual job is?--No.&nbsp;--Wait... What?--OK fine. Super short version:&nbsp;Learning how the Amazon marketplace works for sellers until you can eventually be responsible for the whole system (way down the road). We&rsquo;ll teach you basically everything you need to know so it doesn&rsquo;t matter if you have never dealt with Amazon management before.&nbsp;You&rsquo;re (eventually) gonna be:&nbsp;- The resident expert on Amazon- Evaluating SKUs and deciding what actions should be taken to maximize profitability- Continually consuming new knowledge about the platform trying to find new ways to optimize- Building systems to monitor and improve everything (good luck managing thousands of SKUs without robust systems)- Training others how to do the work for you so you can focus on system improvements that will improve performance across our whole portfolio of products- Figuring out different levers to pull to make more money how to best pull them then build a system and training materials around them so we can scale pulling those levers across thousands of SKUs&nbsp;This is a big job and there is an absolute boatload to learn. &nbsp;We&rsquo;ll teach you everything you need to know but you have to know that we&rsquo;re basically aiming to build you into an executive in the company. We want to find the person to be responsible for this marketplace long-term which hopefully you&rsquo;ll be!&nbsp;--Do I need experience?--We expect you to have a minimum of 70 years of experience (120+ preferred).&nbsp;Oh you haven&#39;t lived two lifetimes eating and breathing Amazon 24/7/365? Who TF do you think you are reading this job description? You absolute buffoon.&nbsp; Oh you haven&#39;t been directly involved in at least two (preferably three) World Wars? You&#39;re not even qualified to operate our coffee machine you sentient potato.&nbsp;Oh you didn&#39;t observe the Big Bang as it happened? Get out of here you pirated copy of Windows 95.&nbsp; I am gonna literally throw up from the mere thought of your hubris that you could apply for this position. Absolutely sickening.&nbsp;Also no you don&#39;t need any experience. &nbsp;We want special people and don&rsquo;t give AF what their background is. Most of our best people did nothing remotely related to their current roles so if you&#39;ve never done anything like this before don&#39;t sweat it. We hire 100x more for potential than existing knowledge. The Big Bang requirement still stands though.&nbsp;--Do I need a college degree?--You just need to be awesome.&nbsp;--Are there any geographic restrictions?--As long as you are in a country that doesn&rsquo;t have active sanctions from the US government we are interested. Our founder isn&rsquo;t known for respecting the government much but they have all the guns so&hellip; &nbsp;--Do I need to have sold on Amazon before?--Nope. &nbsp;--I don&rsquo;t know anything about E-Commerce?--As long as you love learning we&rsquo;ll teach you everything you need to know (or support you in figuring out who can teach you).&nbsp;--I am not great with math?--This role doesn&rsquo;t require calculus or anything like that but you will definitely be looking at spreadsheets of data and performing mathematical analysis on it (nothing too fancy). If you hate math this probably isn&rsquo;t the role for you but you don&rsquo;t have to love math to be successful either.&nbsp;--This sounds pretty good though I&rsquo;m still skeptical that this isn&rsquo;t a pyramid scheme.--You sound just like our tax auditor!&nbsp;--That doesn&rsquo;t resolve any of my fears but what do I need to do to apply?--Please submit your information on the following page to apply. We promise to respond within 5-10 business days even if our answer is No.&nbsp; There will be multiple steps in this process FYI including a long written application interviews with potentially a few different people and paid work test(s). Hiring the right people is really hard and very expensive if we do it poorly so we have to front-load the process. I&#39;m sorry about that and thank you for sticking with us.&nbsp;Once you&rsquo;re in our pipeline though I would anticipate giving you a final answer within a few weeks depending on how it goes. We definitely don&rsquo;t want to string you along and as long as you do what we ask we promise to tell you &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo; and to not just ghost you (like everybody I match with on Tinder).&nbsp;Thank you for your time and interest and I hope we can work together soon!,2023-12-06,Anywhere in the World,2023-12-06 21:26:36.052830

Senior Software Engineer Web Applications,https://remoteOK.com/remote-jobs/remote-senior-software-engineer-web-applications-yard-stick-pbc-521246,About The RoleYard Stick is looking for a Senior Software Engineer to help us combat climate change with soil. We use spectral imaging and machine learning to measure organic soil carbon bringing down the cost of soil measurement and creating incentives for better soil management and carbon sequestration.We are looking for someone who is excited to be part of our mission and part of our small team working on a wide variety of projects both for our customers and our various internal teams. Most of our work is Python (for the data processing end of things) and Ruby (for the web front end) and weâre looking for someone who is expert in at least one of those stacks (and willing to work in the other).This role is on our software team reporting directly to the VP of software and would work in close coordination with our product teams (data science hardware soil science) and our sales business development and field teams. This is a full-time remote position and we are looking to hire as soon as possible.About Yard Stick PBCYard Stick is a remote-first climate tech startup with cofounders based in Boston MA and Oakland CA. We are on a mission to reverse climate change with agriculture. Scientists and farmers alike know that climate-friendly agricultural practices have the potential to remove atmospheric CO2 at gigatoyear scale. When these practices are adopted more carbon is stored in soils improving soil health and fighting climate change. But significant measurement challenges have held soil carbon efforts back - until now.By reducing the cost of soil carbon measurement by 70-90% Yard Stick will dramatically expand the opportunities for evidence-based regenerative practices to simultaneously improve ecosystem health increase farmer income and combat climate change.&nbsp;Current soil carbon measurement technologies are slow expensive and cumbersome relying on conventional soil cores and labs to quantify carbon stocks. In contrast Yard Stick is fast and cheap - without sacrificing accuracy. As a testament to our technologyâs potential alongside our scientific collaborators we were awarded $18M across six USDA Climate-Smart Commodities projects and we have additional grant financing from ARPA-E NSF CDFA and other discerning grant-makers. Weâve also raised another nearly $18M from top climate VCs including Toyota Climate Venture Fund Lowercarbon Capital Breakthrough Energy Ventures (Bill Gatesâ climate fund) Microsoft Climate Innovation Fund The Nature Conservancy Extania Pillar VC MCJ Collectiveâ¦ the list goes on!For more background check out some coverage of Yard Stick in TechCrunch Fast Company and AgFunder.We offer competitive salary and equity (benchmarked to 75th percentile of SF/NYC) health/dental/vision insurance a 401k and home-office reimbursements. We have a number of founders and other team members with young families and have a strong track record of creative flexible approaches to hours and communication expectations which let folks feel great about their commitments both to Yard Stick and their lives outside of work.&nbsp;Weâre also a PBC or public benefit corporation which is an alternative corporate structure which protects our ability to prioritize climate impact over profits if the two are in conflict. You can read more about PBCs in this article which also features Yard Stick.\nResponsibilitiesWork with customers and our business development team to extend our customer portal and APIImprove our geospatial project management and planning tools building sampling plans visualizing GIS data and developing new data services as neededDevelop and enhance internal tools for data review and quality control on collected and analyzed soil dataDevelop and improve our data pipeline machine learning tools model management and anything to help our data science team work more efficientlyQualifications (Must Have)3+ years of relevant work experienceExpertise in web application development either with a standard Ruby+Rails or Python environment plus willingness to work in both stacks (since we use both)Work experience producing professional production quality softwarePassion for climate impactQualifications (Nice To Have)Experience with both of the Ruby and Python stacks mentioned aboveExperience with data analysis using Jupyter notebooks or similarAbility to design and implement great customer experiencesExperience with productionized data processing pipelinesKnowledge of GIS data mapping pathing etc.Familiarity with AWSExperience processing data from hardware sensors(None of these are required but if you have experience in these areas please highlight it in your application!)\n$170 000 - $195 000 a yearCompensation and Other Detailsâ¢ Market salary and equity commensurate with expertise.

(If resident in the U.S. then U.S. work authorization is required.)\nOur Commitment to Diversity Equity and InclusionYard Stickâs impact goals go well beyond climate science. Why? Our company operates primarily in the US agricultural sector which is predicated on centuries of mass land theft and disenfranchisement of Native and Black people. This harm continues today. If weâre going to work in this sector we need to leave it better than we found it.Consistent with our core value of âPursue Justice â we speak up about these issues and we support emerging solutions and relevant policy efforts such as H.R.40 and S.300. We also publicly highlight the risk of further racial discrimination in emerging agricultural legislation like the Growing Climate Solutions Act.Regarding hiring and culture we work to create a work environment where everyone feels confident sharing their ideas problem-solving happens openly and collaboratively and mistake-making is welcomed. We also standardize our interview process and questions to reduce âlikeabilityâ bias benchmark salaries against industry databases to reduce negotiation and utilize tools like the Gender Decoder. Climate change is arguably the most complex challenge ever faced by humanity - we need all of humanity activated to fight back and that motivates us to build a diverse team.Please mention the word **ELEVATE** and tag RMjgwNjoyZjA6NzQyMDpmY2UzOjIwNTQ6YTlmYToyYjo2YTM4 when applying to show you read the job post completely (#RMjgwNjoyZjA6NzQyMDpmY2UzOjIwNTQ6YTlmYToyYjo2YTM4).

Lead WordPress Developer for Fast-Growing Pet Company,https://remotive.com/remote-jobs/software-dev/lead-wordpress-developer-for-fast-growing-pet-company-1854159,(btw heres a quick video that explains the position: https://youtu.be/s8aW66ZB8_o?feature=shared)👉 Are you a talented web developer who loves WordPress? And do you get excited about building new features that will be used by millions of pet lovers every month? Then this could very well be the opportunity for you!   We’re Pangolia—one of the fastest-growing pet companies and we’re on a mission to create the biggest most helpful pet company in the world. Our largest sites: Catster.com Dogster.com Hepper.com and PetKeen.com are visited by more than 60 million pet lovers every year and we’re undergoing rapid growth.   Our media sites are all built on WordPress and our own cat furniture e-commerce brand Hepper is running on WooCommerce.   In this position you would be the lead web developer which will consist of fixing the issues that come up proactively keeping our sites secure and building new things.   We’re a 100% remote company so you’d have the freedom to work from anywhere. Its a full-time position (40 hours a week) yet you get to plan your own schedule and work whenever you want. You will become an integral member of our team at Pangolia consisting of a diverse group of more than 80 talented individuals from all over the world joining us on our united goal of building the biggest most helpful pet company in the world.   📌 Note: we’re a fast-paced kickass team with very high expectations of ourselves and each other and we work really hard. The webdev department needs to become kickass so this position will definitely require working on some weekends.   💻 We’re looking for a fullstack developer. However for this position it is much more important to be great at backend coding than frontend design. Our sites already look great on the front end but it’s mainly on the back end where a lot of work needs to be done. (we also have graphic designers on our team)   💬 Strong communication and team collaboration skills are a MUST. Were a remote company so great communication is a fundamental part of making the company thrive.   —&gt; All in all this is a great opportunity if you’re an amazing developer looking to rapidly grow your skills whilst working alongside peers who are at the top of their field.   Big projects in front of us right now:    Make Catster.com Dogster.com PetKeen.com and Hepper.com the fastest loading websites when compared to our competitors and have fewer display ads than the competition. Build out the Hepper.com e-commerce experience: revamping checkout pages category pages product listings and making sure that data analytics on Hepper is properly configured. Clearing the big backlog of tasks that has piled up over the last couple of months. We are behind and we have lots to do so it’s important that you hit the ground running! In this role you would over the next 3-4 months hire 1-2 developers in your department. So it’s crucial that you’re excited about managing inspiring and doing code reviews with other developers too.    You will be responsible for  Making the webdev department kickass: catching up with the backlog of tasks and being an amazing communicator. After 3-4 hiring months: hiring 1-2 web developers who will work under you. It’s therefore important you are excited about hiring managing and doing code reviews with developers. We can help teach you the skills to hire and manage developers though you must be excited about this for this to work. Developing new tools and software that help millions of pet lovers every month (could for example be to develop a Puppy Weight Chart Tool / Calculator that helps pet owners predict how fast and how big their dog will grow) Developing testing and maintaining new features and solutions for our WordPress sites for desktop and mobile browsers that are optimized for high traffic. Create review and update technical documentation such as contributing to our development processes QA procedures and technical planning Communicating and supporting our content and marketing departments with dev/IT requests troubleshooting fixing bugs Performing scheduled and non-scheduled maintenance and security updates on our WordPress sites Always proactively being on top of things and securing and protecting our WordPress sites from hackers and malware as well as eliminating risks Be informed of relevant new technology and best practices    You are expected to have:    Experience with HTML CSS JavaScript/jQuery and PHP Experience with MySQL and managing databases Experience with WordPress development (e.g. themes hooks filters plugin API etc) Experience with build tools like Webpack or ViteJS Experience with Composer and a basic understanding of autoloading dependency management and dependency injection Experience with SSH and comfortable with basic terminal usage Experience with Git (and GitHub) Troubleshooting abilities (ie include finding CSS and JavaScript conflicts using browser developer tools navigating codebases in theme and plugins and determining whether a plugin or theme code could be causing a code conflict) The ability to take a project on your own and get it done before the deadline Strong communication skills. This is a MUST as we work remotely. (most of our communication is written in Slack with occasional calls)       The Type of Person We Would Love For This Role   —&gt; You are a dependable friendly communicator   —&gt; You’re passionate about solving problems with smart and elegant programming solutions. Your code is clean understandable and well-commented   —&gt; You’re a self-starter who loves taking initiative and seeing things through to completion.   —&gt; You have the curiosity and desire to learn and grow your skills and discover new modern practices and follow the latest trends in WordPress   —&gt; You’re able to juggle around and work on different projects and side tasks on a weekly basis. While we wish we could focus on one thing for weeks at a time to make it perfect that’s often not the reality in a competitive market.   Benefits/Perks when working at Pangolia   🌏 Work from anywhere (we’re 100% remote)   💡 Work with a hard-working talented team of kickass people   🕑 Flexible work hours you get to plan your own schedule and work whenever you want   🌴 Company retreats! (we just did a company retreat in Phuket Thailand!)   💰 Your payment is paid biweekly (You’re paid every two weeks)   💻 We encourage you to find a working environment that suits your needs the best if working from home every single day isn’t for you. (We’ll cover monthly membership and/or day passes for co-working spaces.)⛱️ 21 days of paid time off every year   🤝 Your work with a great talented team that produces a high-growth work environment (we move fast)   📈 Opportunity to move up in the company and earn higher pay and bonuses   Some things to know about our workflow    Every Monday we have a one-on-one Zoom meeting to discuss our goals whether you are meeting your goals what went well what did not go well and so on.    You would work directly with the CEO Simon who trusts you with your responsibility areas and empowers you to come up with and for you to find the solutions. In other words: this role has a lot of freedom for you to work in the way that you think is best for the company. Simon and the team do not micromanage and have no interest in doing so.    You’re also responsible for maintaining the Github repository of the project you’re working on committing/pushing/documenting your changes commenting on your code and writing SOPs or technical documentation (if necessary). It doesn’t have to be pages long and can be very short and concise. But as a developer it makes life so much easier if you can return to your code in the future without having to think too hard about what you did. This is also about being considerate of your teammates time.    There must be some overlap in our working hours so you can respond to urgent requests (if any) or chat with your manager or any of our departments on demand if they have an IT question. This means that some extra tasks may arise during the week.    You might have a day where one of our team members needs something urgent and needs it done the same or the next day which can be valuable to the company or a major issue needs to be fixed ASAP in which case you might have to drop what youre working on and work on that. If your main projects deadline cannot be met because of this (which is understandable) you should be able to communicate this on time.    However most of the time you are able to work on your main projects in solitary. We understand that developers need complete focus. You can also chat and ask questions in our Slack channels.     The team (and our work culture)   You’ll get to be part of a 100% remote company consisting of a diverse group of 80 talented individuals from all over the world. The people you will find on the team are veterinarians marketers content writers editors social media managers graphics designers content managers and a lot more.   And you’ll get to join us on our united mission of improving the lives of pets and those who care for them. We dream big and our mission is to become the biggest most helpful pet company in the world.   You’ll get to be part of a company that’s undergoing hyper-growth and the fast-paced work environment that comes with it.   And we’ve managed to grow at a healthy pace without ever sacrificing our culture and values.   Our company culture is focused on work and collaboration but also being open to the casual humor and chatter that makes us get to know each other.   We value the freedom of being able to work from anywhere trust and collaboration. ,2023-12-06,Worldwide,2023-12-06 21:26:35.537059

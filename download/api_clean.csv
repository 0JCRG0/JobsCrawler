We strongly encourage under-represented groups to apply.
As a Senior Developer Advocate you are a technologist first and will help teach developers SREs administrators and others how to build with Grafana.  That starts with things like dashboards but goes much deeper into APIs plugins any kind of data that helps us understand complex systems and how they function.  You will participate in events author content appear in videos and many other programs.  A big plus for us is if you already participate meaningfully in open source communities such as Kubernetes Prometheus or the wider CNCF.
We work in the R&D part of the organization alongside product managers and engineers.  The aim of the role is to help users build cool stuff.
Reporting to the Director of Developer Advocacy youll work with an all-remote team of advocates and community support engineers.

Build relationships with people across the community to support & inspire
Provide feedback on our products; help be a conduit of what the community is saying to help us improve the feedback loop between what users need and what Grafana delivers

Success in this role is measured by making our users successful. In a few months you either already know or will have learned about our technology and how to improve education for the community.  A few months later you will have worked on several programs in front of our community; you might be submitting talks to conferences and user groups.

When deciding what benefits should look like at Real we started by thinking long and hard about what employees need not only to work well but to live well. Benefits impact how we act rest grieve set boundaries and take care of ourselves and others — and that means quality benefits are a fundamental part of not just a mentally well company but a mentally well society.

We want to give them the support and autonomy they need to feel well and maintain full lives outside of work.
Payout

Competitive salary plus equity in an early-stage startup. Emphasis on “plus”—we won’t use equity to low-ball you.

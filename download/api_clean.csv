This includes server-side client-side and mobile engineers working closely with UX experts copywriters and designers.We follow a Kanban-like approach using Google docs and Asana to specify and manage work; Github CircleCI and Terraform Enterprise as part of an immutable-infrastructure continuous delivery pipeline; and Loggly Sentry and Cloudwatch to measure performance and monitor production.Some of our coding conventions are open-source .Octopus is a great place to learn work with some talented engineers and level-up your skills. Our technologyOn the server-side we mainly use Python. Most of our websites are powered by Django Django-REST-framework and GraphQL (Graphene).

See for example Django ELB health checks and continuous delivery.Client-side we use React Redux and SASS; our mobile apps are built using native code or React Native.What youll do
We have lots of difficult design challenges to solve. The Spanish energy market is complicated outdated and process-heavy - theres an awful lot of domain modelling that we need to get right. Strong attention to detail is essential.
We have difficult technical problems to solve. With the advent of smart meters well soon be processing millions of meter readings a day. We need the right technology in place to handle this smoothly as well as feeding data into a machine learning pipeline that models and predicts consumption.
Theres a great opportunity for disruption in the Spanish energy market. The big suppliers still dominate but are not exactly popular. The energy landscape is changing as we move to more dis-aggregated forms of generation with less predictability more dynamism and smarter technology. Octopus Energy were the first UK supplier to introduce a tracker tariff whose prices track the daily wholesale prices: http://www.cleanenergynews.co.uk/news/efficiency/octopus-offers-transparency-with-wholesale-price-tariff

Youll be working for a company that’s fighting climate change. Our parent company is the largest investor in solar generation in the UK and are funding wind and anaerobic digestion. As a supplier were helping people to use greener technology and renewable energy all helping move the UK towards a lower carbon future.
What youll have
Were looking for someone with a general interest in technology and problem-solving; someone diligent and thoughtful. It would be helpful to have experience/expertise in the following (in rough priority order):
Python
Django (or equiv. web framework)
Domain modelling
HTTP and REST APIs
Writing robust and fault-tolerant software
Celery and async processing
Postgres
English  Spanish
Plus experience in the following would be a bonus:
AWS
Terraform Packer Consul
React and Redux
What youll love about us

We would prefer someone who can work in our Spain (Valencia) office but will consider remote candidates (warning: the bar is much higher).

Why Were Here:
For hundreds of years. businesses have tried to find the right policy to protect themselves and their employees. However commercial insurance is plagued with a big problem: its really complicated!
Insurers find it hard to understand the true exposures of businesses and to profitably provide them with policies that reflect that risk. Businesses - like contractors hotels restaurants transportation fleets real estate lessors and others - struggle to find the coverage they need and are often left underinsured uninsured or paying too much for what they need.
Thats where we come in. Our AI-powered underwriting workbench - Copilot - compiles everything underwriters need and flags the exposures they need to know about. With Copilot underwriters can find critical information in a flash; digitize their underwriting guidelines; triage prioritize and track their book; and automatically read and summarize key documents like loss runs and supplemental applications ‚Äì all out of the box. This means that insurance carriers grow faster and are more profitable and businesses get the right coverage at the right rates. It‚Äôs the way insurance should work.

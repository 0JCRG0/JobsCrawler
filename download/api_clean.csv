The concept of insurance comes from communities in the past who pooled their resources to protect each other from the risks they all faced. It works better the more people are in the pool as the numbers become more reliable. But this method isnât scalable because it is a trust-based system and the network of individuals trusted by everyone in the pool only extends so far. Hence traditional insurance companies emerged.
When Ethereum and smart contracts came along we realised we could apply our insurance industry knowledge to our passion for decentralised technology. We realised we could build a mutual on a platform where individuals only need to trust the system not everyone in it.


Specifically we could see a solution to the problem of agencyâwhere an insurer looks after customers money on their behalf. We also saw the opportunity to make significant cost savings compared to the traditional insurance model. As weâre already in the UK we have the perfect base to build out this concept due to the existing law around mutuality.
The aim is to provide our members with more simple transparent accessible and affordable financial protection against their risks.

Thats where we come in. Our AI-powered underwriting workbench - Copilot - compiles everything underwriters need and flags the exposures they need to know about.

While being flooded with never ending IT tickets they are also making sure Guy Fieri in Sales doesn’t buy yet another tool “promising” a 103% lead conversion rate. And burying themselves in spreadsheets to prepare the SOC2 report for when Gordon Ramsey from the Big 4 comes knocking. And can’t forget about Julia Child the newest on-call engineer who needs access to prod DB to investigate an incident. All of these workstreams are among spreadsheets emails Slack messages and Zoom calls. But those days are numbered.

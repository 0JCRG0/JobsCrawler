Founding Designer,https://dribbble.com/jobs/235299-Founding-Designer?source=index,"✍🏻 About daydreamdaydream is a platform that automates programmatic SEO, end-to-end.The platform helps businesses identify search patterns, creates content at scale, and automatically improves that content.Weve raised >$2M from leading investors like Basis Set Ventures, WndrCo, SOMA Capital and current and former Heads of Growth/Product Growth at companies like Notion, Airtable, Webflow and Dropbox. Were on a high-growth trajectory and were looking for people who want to join us on the journey to building a billion-dollar company.Our team previously worked together at Flixed, a startup we bootstrapped to $2M+ in revenue almost purely on the back of programmatic SEO.🔧 The Problem we’re trying to solveHeads of Growth love programmatic SEO. It’s the secret growth playbook used by companies like Zapier, Canva, to acquire millions of visitors. The problem is, building a pSEO engine currently requires work from SEO analysts, content marketers, software engineers, data scientists and others. As a result, it’s logistically complicated and expensive. You can hire specialized agencies, but they cost $50K+ per month.🧑‍💻 How we’re solving this problemdaydream is building a SaaS platform that automates every piece of building a programmatic SEO engine. Everything from identifying search queries, to producing 90th percentile quality content at scale, all the way to automatically updating that content.🪴 Why we’re hiringDemand for daydream is growing fast as our ARR has already doubled since the inception of our company, all before launching a generally available product. This is exciting, but it also means we need to hire to build product faster and meet the demand. We’re looking for senior engineers that are excited to work with LLMs to serve one of the biggest markets in the world.👋🏻 The People and EnvironmentHere are three key elements of our culture: Push the pace No sandbagging allowed! Everyone at daydream is expected to proactively identify when a particular goal can be met faster, and to push for acceleration. A real example of how this value has been applied — we initially thought we would hit a certain revenue milestone within 1 year. We realized we can do it in half the time, so we shortened our timeline to hit that goal to 5 months instead. Build something you’re proud of Speed of execution is important, but only if it’s in service of delivering a delightful experience to the customer. We want you to look back at what you’ve built at daydream and feel a deep sense of satisfaction. A real example of how this value has been applied — In the past, we’ve prioritized “wowing” the customer at each release of daydream, even at the earliest phases. Speed is no excuse for delivering a poor experience. Five star customer service only The bar for customer service at daydream is always exceeding the customer’s expectations. It is not “meeting” the customer’s expectations. A real example of how this value has been applied — We’ve had situations where the customer is unintentionally moving slower than is possible with their SEO strategy. In these situations, we’ve proactively encouraged the customer to move faster. 🤝 The people you’ll be working withThenuka (CEO): Thenuka was previously the founder at CEO at Flixed, which he bootstrapped to $2M+ in revenue almost exclusively using programmatic SEO. Prior to that he was an Entrepreneur-in-Residence at Hustle Fund and Chief of Staff to the COO at Pango, a cybersecurity company with $100M+ in annual revenue.Shravan (Founding Engineer): Shravan was previously an Engineering Lead at Flixed. Before that, Shravan worked as a Software Engineer at Facebook for three years, where he worked on mass-scale web scraping for Facebooks’ Jobs product, and Meta Reality Labs.Kelsey (Marketing Lead): Kelsey previously led marketing at Flixed, and before that, content and SEO at MarketerHire. She has also worked as a freelance writer and content strategist for clients like Discovery.🌀 Skills that we value in this role Experience designing 0 → 1 products: You’ll be the only designer on the team, so you’ll need to feel comfortable taking on all facets of design from UX to UI. (Bonus) Front-end engineering experience: If you know how to build your designs, that’s a major plus! Clear thinking and communication: This role will interface with all other parts of the company, so the ability to communicate your thinking clearly is important. 👷🏻‍♀️ What You’ll Be Doing HereOwnership areas Designing the daydream web app: Our team is only a few people, and you’ll be the only designer. We’ll look to you to take the lead on the design of the daydream app, considering how accessible it is to the user. App Quality and UX: You’ll be responsible for maintaining a high-quality bar for the app design. Work closely with our engineer throughout the product cycle to ensure the app is intuitive for users. We want to move fast, but not at the cost of quality. Working with customers: An essential part of this role is engaging with customers, gathering feedback, and understanding their needs. You’ll need to translate this feedback into actionable design requirements and improvements, ensuring that the app continually evolves in alignment with user needs. 1 month: Build context: You’ll get to know Thenuka, Kelsey, Shravan, and the rest of the team as you work on the daydream app. The front end uses a T3-inspired React stack and is written in Typescript. You’ll gain an understanding of our app structure and roadmap. Learn the product: We believe that it’s important for everyone on the team to understand our product well. So, soon after you join, you’ll work with Thenuka to create and deliver content to an actual customer. This will help you understand the technology we have and share your ideas! Make your first design change: You’ll start by redesigning portions of the front end we have already built. Your first few projects will be improving on past designs and gradually ease into leading design in parallel with engineering. Within 1 month, you’ll already have some of your designs live and start to work with engineering with new designs. 3 months: Research exploratory ideas: Youve implemented design improvements as you learned the ropes. With the context you’ve gained on the product, help research our more exploratory product design. Data can help guide decisions, but instinct is important too.

Privacy loving Linux generalist,https://www.fossjobs.net/job/11299/privacy-loving-linux-generalist-at-tails/,"Summary The Foundations Team at Tails is hiring a Linux generalist. Tails is a portable operating system that protects against surveillance and censorship. The Foundations Team is responsible for maintaining, releasing, and improving Tails. We work remotely, and do not have a traditional office space. About Tails Tails makes digital security tools accessible to everyone, whenever they need it: activists, journalists, freedom fighters, and ultimately, you, whenever you need extra privacy in this digital world. The Tails project was started in 2009 and has now more than 30 000 daily users. Read more about our mission and values Non-profit We put our users first, not profits. Equal opportunity, equal pay We are committed to creating an inclusive and equitable environment for all. We have a transparent compensation scheme where everybody enjoys comparable pay and benefits. Small team We are a small team that values transparency, autonomy, and horizontal decision-making. About this position Role description You are a Linux generalist who likes analyzing and solving technical problems in many different areas of a GNU/Linux system. You can dedicate at least 20 hours a week to Tails, although 30 hours a week would be ideal. You will join our Foundations Team, whose many responsibilities are divided among its members. We do not expect any single member to take all these responsibilities themselves — it’s a team effort! Our main activity is what we call “plumbing”: gluing things together without necessarily understanding in depth every individual part. You will be responsible for releasing Tails once every 2 months. Managing Tails’s release is a 2-day shift during which you will work a bit more than usual, and at unusual times. We plan this shift in advance, and rotate this responsiblity within the team. You will be a Core Worker. Core Workers are in charge of maintaining not only an operating system but also the good health of the project as a whole. Together, we continuously discuss and improve organizational and strategic aspects of the project. Requirements We encourage you to apply if: You have significant experience with GNU/Linux, and system administration basics. Ideally this would be on Debian or one of its derivatives. If your experience is about other Linux environments, that’s fine: be ready to learn lots of Debian-specific stuff! You are somewhat familiar, or at least excited about, modern Linux desktop and GNOME technologies,such as D-Bus, GTK, Flatpak, systemd, etc. You have intermediate familiarity with: one programming language among Python and Ruby POSIX-like shell scripting, such as Bash as a bonus: JavaScript or Object-oriented Perl with Moo You like to learn new stuff: Tails is big and you probably don’t know everything yet — nobody does! You have good verbal and written communication skills in English. You are self-organized, systematic, able to set priorities and manage timelines. You are interested in how groups of people communicate, express & hear needs & feelings, handle crisis & conflicts, organize work, and make decisions. You are enthusiastic about our mission and values, motivated by social impact. You have some experience working fully remote, primarily with asynchronous communication. You can work comfortably at least 3 hours during the peak of Tails activities: between 10:00 and 17:00 Europe/Berlin. Working conditions Given how Tails work is organized, you will: Primarily work remotely and asynchronously with other people, who may live in a different time zone. Use GitLab, email, Jabber/XMPP, and video calls. Also meet in-person a few times a year. Participate in self-organizing a team whose members have varying degrees of involvement and complementary skill sets. For example: attend remote and face to face team meetings, triage bugs together, collectively build a roadmap. If you identify as being part of a group that is under-represented in Free and Open Source Software communities, we particularly encourage you to apply. Tails is not as diverse as we would like it to be. For example, paid workers at Tails are currently all cis-males, predominantly white. We are committed to creating a more inclusive and respectful work environment, which would be welcoming to more diverse people. Compensation and benefits Pay scale is 40–90 k€ per year for 20-30 hours a week, including medical coverage. The exact number depends solely on: How much time you work Your tax situation Cost of medical coverage On top of this, Tails pays for: Exceptional health expenses not covered by your policy Computer equipment Travel expenses to work events How to apply Send an email to tails-jobs@riseup.net",2023-12-06,"at

Elasticsearch consultant,https://www.fossjobs.net/job/11264/elasticsearch-consultant-at-the-organized-crime-and-corruption-reporting-project-occrp/,"Application deadline: 30/06/2023About OCCRPThe Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) is a growing, global nonprofit media organization that is reinventing investigative journalism for the public good. By developing and equipping a global network of investigative journalists and publishing their stories, we expose crime and corruption so the public can hold power to account. We see a future where organized crime and corruption are drastically reduced and democracy is strengthened. Our global team includes editors, researchers, data engineers, security specialists, administrators, technologists, and strategists, each with areas of in-depth expertise.AlephTo support investigative journalists and member centers in their work to uncover corruption and hold power to account, OCCRP developed an investigative data platform called OCCRP Aleph. The platform serves as a central repository for exploring leaks, datasets and and data-dumps that are critical to effective investigative journalism. This platform now contains over 3 billion records and has served as a cornerstone in many global groundbreaking investigations. The platform allows journalists to ingest documents and both structured and unstructured data, and maps that data to an ontology that we developed called Follow the Money. Users can then search across all Aleph datasets to find connections, entities and cross-reference entities between datasets to uncover wrongdoing and patterns. This is largely possible through our use of Elasticsearch (ES), which is a central part of the application enabling rapid search through records. The platform that we’ve developed runs in a kubernetes cluster hosted on GCP. Our ES cluster comprises 21 Nodes including 3 master nodes. Each node uses a 2Tb SSD with 26Gb RAM and 4 vCPUs.The user-facing side of Aleph is written in Python and React with a Postgres database and an accompanying suite of CLI tools.The ProjectThe ChallengeAleph has now been in use for over seven years and in that time our ES index has grown significantly. The ES index is currently 30Tb and is increasing in size all the time. Although this growth is a testament to the success of the platform and the popularity of it with our users, it has brought with it very significant running costs.As such, the primary goal of this project is to investigate and optimize our current ES setup, in the hope of making it more space-efficient and cost effective and without impacting performance or usefulness of the platform for our users. Where you can helpAs an ElasticSearch expert, you will work closely with the Aleph development team to: ● Audit the current ElasticSearch implementation and propose possible tweaks and other ‘low-hanging-fruit’ changes we could make to improve cost efficiency. ● Understand the current ES setup and implementation and how it is tied into Aleph’s core functionality.● Investigate avenues for potential improvement of cost efficiency.● Propose architectural changes (small or large) to our ES implementation or Aleph as a whole that could significantly improve cost effectiveness without compromising performance.● Help us implement these changes (development, planning, architecture) when we know what they are.As the expert we’d expect you to make recommendations but there are several avenues that we’ve considered:● Optimizing our existing configuration to try and reduce the size of our index.● Setting up hot/cold nodes within the index for less frequently accessed data where longer retrieval time is more acceptable.● Refactoring the way in which data is split across indexes to allow better more efficient searches.● Setting up an archive process for taking data offline (and reducing the size of our index).What you bring to the table● Significant experience working with elasticsearch and ideally with performance and cost optimization.● Ideally experience working with an NGO● Solutions-oriented outlook and collaborative mindset to bring creative solutions to the tableHow to applyIf you’re interested in helping us with the project, either as an individual or as an organization we’d love to hear from you.For IndividualsIf you’re an individual interested in getting involved, please email us a copy of your CV along with a cover letter detailing your interest and daily rates to jobs(at)occrp.org Once we’re received this we’ll evaluate and reach out.For OrganizationsIf you’re an organization looking to provide us with professional services then please email us at jobs(at)occrp.org including information on your organization, your rates, availability, and why you believe that you are best placed to help us, and we’ll arrange a time to talk.All applications must be submitted in English.

Managing Director,https://www.fossjobs.net/job/11227/managing-director-at-matrixorg-foundation/,"The Matrix.org Foundation is a non-profit UK Community Interest Company that serves as both a guardian and champion of Matrix, an open standard and protocol for real-time communication that is used by an ever-growing global community. Matrix is to communicating in the 21st century what e-mail was to sending messages in the 20th – an interoperable and federated protocol that makes it possible for anyone, anywhere in the world, to connect to users anywhere on the global network in a safe, reliable manner. While work on Matrix began in 2014, today ongoing development of the specification is entrusted to the Foundation, currently led by a group of five Guardians who keep a watchful eye on the Matrix Spec Core Team and its work, making sure the community stays true to its overall philosophy. To date, most of the work of the Foundation has been provided through in-kind efforts of ecosystem leaders, such as Element. These contributions have included general outreach and advocacy for Matrix, operation of the massively popular Matrix.org homeserver, and funding software development for projects including end-to-end encryption, client SDKs and Synapse, the Matrix reference homeserver implementation. While these external contributions have been and remain critical, the Foundation takes seriously its responsibility to the long-term success of Matrix, and so recently began to transition into a more direct and hands-on role in key areas. The Role As we begin to prepare for the 2nd decade of Matrix and respond to the community’s rapid growth, the Foundation is seeking its first Managing Director to: (a) build support for the evolution of the ecosystem of service providers and software developers building technology and services on the Matrix protocol, (b) to oversee development and operations of key technology infrastructure and community resources, and © to help ensure the Foundation’s fiscal sustainability for the long term in order to provide stability and assurance to users and contributors. This role is responsible for strategy, operations, and fundraising for the Foundation in service to the larger Matrix community. The role reports to the newly-forming Matrix Governing Board via the long-established committee of Guardians who have deep ongoing experience with the ecosystem’s history, successes, and challenges. The person in this role will also initially be responsible for taking over certain tasks from predecessor volunteers and outsourced providers, including such tasks as annual tax & reporting filings, maintenance of the Foundation’s online presence, and overseeing key community events/programs/activities (conferences, participation in standards groups, Google Summer of Code, etc.). Requirements The Foundation’s inaugural Managing Director will have an especially critical responsibility to design strategic plans, operational approaches, and help to build a culture that is aligned with the long-term goals of the Matrix community and to the extent possible supports its work in all its forms. You will not only need to build the plans for the future of the Foundation, you will also be responsible to raise funds to execute those plans, and then transform those plans into reality through building internal teams and ecosystem partnerships. Specifically, we are looking for someone who is: * Intellectually and emotionally smart, naturally curious, and deeply enthusiastic about our mission. * A compelling and articulate communicator (both in written form and through public speaking) who takes great pleasure in helping others be successful. * Empathetic, with not only Matrix ecosystem members, but also users and potential supporters. * Comfortable with the pace, trade offs, and ambiguity of an early stage non-profit organization, and who remembers how to balance their own self-care alongside caring for and supporting others in our community. * Comfortable “wearing many hats” and taking on a variety of roles temporarily as the organization builds its team. * Not afraid to explain to people that changing the world takes both resources and money, and to enthusiastically solicit financial support for the Foundation in doing so. Your experience First and foremost, we are looking for someone who is deeply passionate about the Matrix mission for democratising communication, and who will be an outspoken advocate for our work. We also need someone with not only deep experience in building organizations and communities, but also in organizational development work such as fundraising and partnership building. We expect the successful candidate to have the following experience: * Past experience building a fundraising pipeline to support annual operating budgets. Based on the desired activities of the Foundation, our target annual budgets will be in the $4-5M range. * Existing access to a wide network of funding organizations and comfort making contact with new organizations to build relationships and solicit support. * Experience leading free and open source software projects. * Experience with implementing and supporting back-office technology such as project management tools, CRM (for members management) and fundraising campaign software. The following attributes will make your application stand out even more: Experience with software development practices (e.g. coding, QA, design, management) will help to understand the needs and challenges of Matrix contributors. Hands-on experience with the Matrix project, such as software development or running your own homeserver, would help you to better understand some of the practical issues and roadmap for Matrix. Technical experience with other real-time messaging platforms would be helpful for the same reasons. * We are a global project and expect to work with community members, partners, and donors in multiple countries. So past experience working with colleagues across multiple countries, as is fluency in multiple written and spoken languages. Benefits This position is designed to be remote. Most of your colleagues will be located in Europe, so you should be willing and able to readily communicate in those time zones. As the first official role directly serving the Foundation, we are opening this role as an independent contractor/consultant relationship in order to provide maximum flexibility in the early phase of the newly-energized organization. As is the case with most new organizations yet to name a leader, funding is currently limited but we will work to both provide flexibility to the right person, and to provide fair compensation that is competitive with other similar opportunities qualified candidates may have. Depending on a candidate’s needs and situation, we may also be able to offer a direct hire relationship if needed. Because this role will be the first paid role in the organization, employee benefits are not yet established. However, once recurring funding is secured the Foundation’s current leadership is committed to a budget and building revenue sources that will accommodate a competitive benefits package for all employees, including retirement savings, allowances for workspace costs, paid leave, and healthcare benefits as necessary. The Matrix.org Foundation does not discriminate on the basis of race, sex, colour, religion, age, national origin, marital status, disability, veteran status, genetic information, sexual orientation, gender identity or any other reason prohibited by law in provision of employment opportunities and benefits. How To Apply If you are interested in this role and think you might be qualified, we encourage you to get in touch with us. We especially encourage people subject to systematic bias or impacted by underrepresentation in the technical industry to apply. Even if you don’t check every item in this job description, if you meet some of the core criteria and are eager and able to take on the role’s responsibilities, we would like to hear from you. Please send a CV or resume of your relevant experience, contact information (including a Matrix ID if you have one!), and a one-page cover letter describing why you think you might be a good fit for this role. We will contact those candidates who are short-listed on a rolling basis as we receive application materials, so please don’t delay in applying. We may request examples of your past relevant work in order to better understand how your experience would work in our organization. The Matrix.org Foundation is eager to have a new leader as soon as possible, and the Matrix community is ready to grow with this role’s support!",2023-12-06,"at

We are a global project and expect to work with community members, partners, and donors in multiple countries. So past experience working with colleagues across multiple countries, as is fluency in multiple written and spoken languages. Benefits This position is designed to be remote. Most of your colleagues will be located in Europe, so you should be willing and able to readily communicate in those time zones. As the first official role directly serving the Foundation, we are opening this role as an independent contractor/consultant relationship in order to provide maximum flexibility in the early phase of the newly-energized organization. As is the case with most new organizations yet to name a leader, funding is currently limited but we will work to both provide flexibility to the right person, and to provide fair compensation that is competitive with other similar opportunities qualified candidates may have. Depending on a candidate’s needs and situation, we may also be able to offer a direct hire relationship if needed. Because this role will be the first paid role in the organization, employee benefits are not yet established. However, once recurring funding is secured the Foundation’s current leadership is committed to a budget and building revenue sources that will accommodate a competitive benefits package for all employees, including retirement savings, allowances for workspace costs, paid leave, and healthcare benefits as necessary. The Matrix.org Foundation does not discriminate on the basis of race, sex, colour, religion, age, national origin, marital status, disability, veteran status, genetic information, sexual orientation, gender identity or any other reason prohibited by law in provision of employment opportunities and benefits. How To Apply If you are interested in this role and think you might be qualified, we encourage you to get in touch with us. We especially encourage people subject to systematic bias or impacted by underrepresentation in the technical industry to apply. Even if you don’t check every item in this job description, if you meet some of the core criteria and are eager and able to take on the role’s responsibilities, we would like to hear from you. Please send a CV or resume of your relevant experience, contact information (including a Matrix ID if you have one!), and a one-page cover letter describing why you think you might be a good fit for this role. We will contact those candidates who are short-listed on a rolling basis as we receive application materials, so please don’t delay in applying. We may request examples of your past relevant work in order to better understand how your experience would work in our organization. The Matrix.org Foundation is eager to have a new leader as soon as possible, and the Matrix community is ready to grow with this role’s support!",2023-12-06,"at

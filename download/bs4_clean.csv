Senior Data Scientist Sales,https://ai-jobs.net/job/106596-senior-data-scientist-sales/,"
Who we are. . .
Pearl Health is restoring the independence and joy of practicing medicine for doctors in the United States. Our healthcare system has burdened our doctors with too much process while removing them from what they do best: caring for those we love most. We are a team of physicians and public health experts (Stanford Dartmouth Harvard Mass. General) technologists (athenahealth Apple Amazon Meta Flatiron WalMart Health) healthcare innovators (Oscar Aledade VillageMD Stellar Arcadia) and experienced risk management professionals (CVS/Aetna Humana Cigna United) who believe that primary care providers (PCPs) are the key to the United States’  future health. Pearl recently announced a strategic partnership to proliferate value-based care with Walgreens one of the largest healthcare companies in the country. Our investors include Andreessen Horowitz Viking Global Investors AlleyCorp and SV Angel. 
 
Pearl Health helps PCPs who are overwhelmed by the demands of an aging population and the unpredictable business model inherent to Traditional Medicare. Over time this solution will empower PCPs to provide better care to their entire patient population. We believe there is a need to bring humanism back to healthcare by giving physicians the ability to better allocate their time with patients increasing their autonomy creating incentives that are aligned with achieving better outcomes through clinical decision-making powered by actionable intelligence and making risk more available and more readily optimized through an intelligent marketplace. The Center for Medicare and Medicaid (CMS) is launching a new value-based care program to disrupt Traditional Medicare and we believe that this represents an opportunity to achieve the meaningful change we envision.

Help us refine our product-market fit by providing strategic guidance as to what aspects of the sales offerings are compelling and which aren’t working.
Ensure quality and availability of various data sources:  lead information sales touchpoint info evolution of financial analyses shared with a lead and deal terms.

What a Senior Data Scientist Sales means to us during the off-cycle…

Research payment models that resonate with providers and power our go-to-market motion.
Enable the support of the growth motion through design and implementation of technical systems.
Deepen knowledge of the healthcare models and programs in which Pearl is operating (e.g. ACO REACH MSSP Medicare Advantage).
Evaluate vendors to help us better understand our customers and the market.

Who you are…

8+ years of experience in performing results-driven quantitative analysis in a healthcare management or professional consulting environment although strong candidates with less experience will certainly be considered.
A degree in statistics applied math computer science engineering or a related field (e.g. healthcare policy) is strongly preferred.
SQL expertise and strong foundation in at least one of the main data science programming languages (Python R Julia Scala Matlab). Python is our current primary language and is preferred. 
A thoughtful collaborator who is able to design and execute quantitatively-driven business processes in a way that balances deep insight and fast turnaround.
Eloquent communicator of  quantitative analyses in particular those relating to financial estimates or healthcare to a lay audience.
A proven ability to apply research and analytic models to inform growth operations including product-market fit the development of sales collateral and the evolution of RevOps (“GrowthOps” in Pearl-speak) workflows.

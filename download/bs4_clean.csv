Our customers include new and established merchants in ecommerce fulfillment companies managing stores for their clients and internationally-recognized people and brandsto name a few.
About us 

We view customer support as essential to making a good product. The problems and questions our customers bring to us are what create the foundation of every project we work on so we are all involved in support in some way. This allows everyone in our company to be in tune with our customers and knowledgeable about our product and the way it’s being used.
We are committed to diversity and inclusion. We are serious about everyone on our team feeling safe comfortable heard and valued at work.
We are self-funded. We are committed to growing responsibly and working creatively within the constraints of our own progress. Our goal is to make a useful accessible product based on the needs of our customers not the demands of investors.
We believe that remote work is the future. Being a remote company offers us the ability to connect with a team of people from all around the world. We also understand that each person has their own unique approach to their workflow and we trust our employees to manage their own time within their set working hours while keeping in mind that this role includes time-sensitive work.
We believe in quality not quantity. We don’t use metrics or KPIs to measure the success of our teams. While productivity and response times are important providing stellar support and empathy to our customers is the priority.
We are generous. We teach and learn from each other on a daily basis. Decisions are often made collectively based on the wisdom and experience we each bring to the conversation.

About the role 

This is a full-time Senior PHP developer position. Our application is written in PHP and connects to over 300 third-party services to import and export orders shipments and product information to and from these other services.
You will primarily be responsible for writing code by following best practices and standards with guidance from our experienced Principal Engineer and Product Architect.

Decisions are often made collectively based on the experience we each bring to the conversation. We are willing to look beyond our ideas and comforts to grow our potential and do the right thing for our customers and each other.
We are currently in the process of rewriting our existing platform to modernize its architecture with scalability and maintainability in mind. You’ll be responsible of collaborating in building of the back-end and the front-end code of the new version and to ensure it is up to code base and industry standards. Our platform integrates with over 300 3rd parties and this brings up fun challenges we tackle every day. We utilize JavaScript and SCSS for our user interfaces and interactivity. On the back-end we work with PHP ^8 without a specific framework.
Here’s what a typical day at Order Desk looks like: You log in to work and ping a wave hello as you sip your favorite morning beverage. There’ve been discussions around the next feature we’ll be building with scalability maintainability and customer experience in mind. You pick up a task that is assigned to you and start writing your feature or bugfix and make sure it is well tested. As you do so you follow the code and quality standards set for the project you’re working on. Once you are happy with your code you push your feature branch up for review. You notice that you are tagged in two pull requests and review those to ensure they do what is defined in the specification and are up to standards. Some days you’re building UI components with SCSS or interactivity using JavaScript. Other days you’re refactoring the PHP backend of existing services.

Benefits
This is a full-time position. The salary for this role is USD 87000 annually.

We try to meet in person every year or two for a company retreat. In 2023 we met in Mexico! The year before we met in Oregon.
Order Desk is committed to breaking structural barriers within our hiring process and driving fair hiring practices in our workplace. Women and underrepresented minorities (URMs) continue to be underrepresented within our industry. Research has shown women and people of color disproportionately do not apply for jobs where they do not meet 100% of the requirements. Regardless of whether or not you identify as one of these groups if you meet most of the requirements and this role aligns with your career goals then we encourage you to bet on yourself and apply!
To Apply
We are not expecting a cover letter and would rather you spend time answering the questions we have listed. We know it’s a little unconventional to go through a job application process like ours but we are very intentional with the questions to give us a chance to get to know you. Don’t worry we won’t ask you to complete a test or share your screen during a call because pressure produces diamonds and not our people.
There are a few steps to our application process:

Application Questions
Video Response
Interview(s)

If you are moved to the next round we will contact you to let you know the next steps.
Our hiring team is pretty small so this process usually takes about 3-4 weeks so we appreciate your patience while we review each application. By the conclusion of this process we will follow up with everyone who applied.

Senior Manager Data Analytics,https://ai-jobs.net/job/110956-senior-manager-data-analytics/,"
Who we are. . .
Pearl Health is restoring the independence and joy of practicing medicine for doctors in the United States. Our healthcare system has burdened our doctors with too much process while removing them from what they do best: caring for those we love most. We are a team of physicians and public health experts (Stanford Dartmouth Harvard Mass. General) technologists (athenahealth Apple Amazon Meta Flatiron WalMart Health) healthcare innovators (Oscar Aledade VillageMD Stellar Arcadia) and experienced risk management professionals (CVS/Aetna Humana Cigna United) who believe that primary care providers (PCPs) are the key to the United States’  future health. Pearl recently announced a strategic partnership to proliferate value-based care with Walgreens one of the largest healthcare companies in the country. Our investors include Andreessen Horowitz Viking Global Investors AlleyCorp and SV Angel. 
Pearl Health helps PCPs who are overwhelmed by the demands of an aging population and the unpredictable business model inherent to Traditional Medicare. Over time our solution will empower PCPs to provide better care to their entire patient population. We believe there is a need to bring humanism back to healthcare by giving physicians the ability to better allocate their time with patients increasing their autonomy creating incentives that are aligned with achieving better outcomes through clinical decision-making powered by actionable intelligence and making risk sharing more available and readily optimized through an intelligent marketplace. The Center for Medicare and Medicaid (CMS) is launching a new value-based care program to disrupt Traditional Medicare and we believe that this represents an opportunity to achieve the meaningful change we envision.

Work with Engineering and Technical Operations to advise on the design and implementation of the platform used to store and serve up data.  This work will involve contemplation of infrastructural components data ontologies and data models and schemas.
Architect and manage a data transformation stack (dbt and PySpark).
Manage the tools and systems that we use to produce our analyses and directly interface with the vendors that supply those tools for the purpose of evaluation procurement and support.
Educate and elevate your colleagues by promoting a culture of critical thinking data analysis and data visualization.

Experience managing complicated projects on tight timelines across multiple business verticals and serving up data products and analyses with high performance and reliability.
We prefer candidates with 2+ years of experience managing 1 or more employees including mentorship and professional development.  Candidates with sufficiently strong backgrounds in other areas will be considered even if lacking prior people management experience.
Experience building ELT pipelines (preferably in either dbt or PySpark) with particular focus on the development of sensible data ontologies and mapping that framework to a schema; the testing of raw intermediate and processed data elements; and the documentation of the design and operation of the pipeline.
Familiarity with one or more modern BI tools and a demonstrated ability to mentor non-analysts about the use of these tools.
Deep exposure to the design implementation and administration of a data lake and data warehouse including the underlying cloud-based technologies.  AWS experience is preferred.

Striveworks: Better Models Faster
The world has looked to data analytics to bridge the gap between floods of data and the struggle to use that data effectively to make timely impactful decisions. Today most organizations are awash in analytics that “aren’t quite right”—models that were developed too generally or too slowly to be effective in dynamic fast-paced environments. Striveworks is simplifying machine learning operations (MLOps) with a powerful and extensible platform that instantiates the data analytic process as code. 
Striveworks is trusted by leading Fortune 500 firms as well as leaders in the public sector as a primary solution for managing model development monitoring and governance—and ensuring that those models solve the real challenges their organizations face.
Striveworks’ Chariot platform enables users to turn their own production data into models and turn models into production systems. Uniquely as you train test deploy and use models our lineage system enables you to track not only the “upstream” provenance of model and data sources but also the “downstream” usage of the resultant model inferences. Combining this with a principled experience for data and model development Chariot gives our customers in highly regulated industries an unmatched governance solution on top of a performant MLOps platform.

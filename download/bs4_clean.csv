Producing a bank of commonly used slides that share thematic brand consistency is the main focus of Project 1.- Our logo is our most recognisable brand asset. We have attempted to bring this logo to life in the past using logo extensions and various 2D/3D graphic design projects.- We are using Canva Vs. Powerpoint. There is a lower skill barrier for our team to edit using Canva and there is the opportunity to bring data directly into our presentations using Flourish Studio. All designs must be Canva friendly.

About Shakepay
Shakepay is reimagining financial services to give every Canadian their fair shake by making it bitcoin-friendly secure and rewarding.

Full Stack Developer
Imagine shaking your phone to instantly earn bitcoin. Our customers might think it’s magic but if you’re reading this you probably know that it’s not (or is it?). It’s not. It’s our stellar dev team that makes it happen. That shaking idea started as a secret easter-egg for our fledgling customer base and once word got out about it we suddenly had to deal with service outages from too many people shaking at the same time.
Of course we’ve since solved that problem and now with over 1000000 shakers (aka “customers) it’s a core part of our identity—not the shaking but the idea that we came up with something new and exciting in the slow and boring world of financial services. We’re looking for an intermediate full stack developer to help us reimagine how Canadians build wealth and think about what they can do with their money. Unique ideas and the knowledge and determination to make them a reality: that’s the real magic.
Totally real Shakepay reviews from the future after you join:
⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Does Shakepay run on literal magic?
⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ I thought magic wasn’t real. Using Shakepay changed my mind.
⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Wow it must’ve taken all 3 genie wishes to make this app!
Oh yeah we’re a bitcoin platform. In fact Shakepay is the easiest way for Canadians to buy and earn bitcoin. We’ve got a one of a kind community of shakers (aka “customers”) that keeps on growing regardless of how the crypto market is doing. They love Shakepay almost as much as they love bitcoin which is really saying something. To the Bitcoin Golden Age!
You will :

Participate in building financial products of the future
Write high quality well-tested production level code
Participate in code reviews
Collaborate on setting a tech vision for the company

Must have:

5+ years working experience as a software developer
Be comfortable working across the tech stack
Killer video-call hangout backgrounds
A healthy resistance to the use of monkey paws

Nice to have:

Experience with Node.js React-Native Vue Postgres Docker
Experience with building financial apps
Some bitcoin knowledge
The secret password to the Cave of Wonders… we think it’s “open seed phrase” or something like that

Why join:

Competitive Salary - Base salary for this role will be $150000 to $190000 with additional equity options & benefits to make up the total compensation package.

How were different
We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. Were an extremely collaborative group and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such we greatly value communication skills. We do not have boundaries between engineering and research and we expect all of our technical staff to contribute to both as needed.
The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic including: GPT-3 Circuit-Based Interpretability Multimodal Neurons Scaling Laws AI & Compute Concrete Problems in AI Safety and Learning from Human Preferences.
Come work with us!

Full-Stack Engineer,https://tryremotely.com/jobs/toku-full-stack-engineer-65140,"


About Toku
Crypto has had tremendous growth over the last several years. That growth comes with inevitable regulation. Regulation in our view is a good thing because once the industry passes through this phase then crypto can access the rest of the world.
We believe it’s going to be the companies that enable this transition from the pre-regulation to post-regulation industry and the companies that can properly navigate it or better yet be the ones that facilitate it - those are the most relevant companies in this next wave. Toku will be one of those companies.
Toku’s products enable crypto-native companies to compliantly compensate their teams in both fiat and tokens in over 100 teams globally. Toku’s growing list of customers includes Aragon Astar dYdX Filecoin Foundation Gitcoin Gnosis Hedera Hashgraph Mina Protocol Labs Teller Safe Storyverse and others.
Paying people with tokens is such an obvious first real-world use case of any token. It doesn’t matter what the token does. All tokens can be used to compensate workers. And in fact are! Toku ensures that all the worker compensation that all those tokens need to do can be done legally and proper taxes paid is a critical part of the transition to a post-regulation crypto industry.
Toku raised $20 million from a consortium led by Blockchain Capital with Protocol Labs GMJP OrangeDAO Orrick Reverie Quantstamp Next Web Capital and prominent angel investors including Protocol Labs founder Juan Benet and Alchemy co-founders Nikil Viswanathan and Joe Lau.Read more about Toku inFortuneYahoo Finance andCoinDesk.

Senior Fullstack Engineer,https://tryremotely.com/jobs/bonusly-senior-fullstack-engineer-65122,"


About Bonusly Engineering:
We believe velocity is the rate at which we deliver value to our customers not the rate at which we ship code. And this pushes us to center our work around customers; “How will this change Im about to make help our customers?”.
When we’re coding were making hundreds of micro-decisions that add up to a person’s experience with the product. We’re in a unique position because we dogfood what we build (Bonusly uses Bonusly) and that helps us form opinions about what works. Engineers also work with Product Management and Design to define problems we solve. Knowing the customer means spending some time away from the code.
The Role: 
Engineers have the freedom to create a ton of impact for our customers. The role requires high agency and comfort with change. It requires people who believe the interesting problems in Engineering are stack-agnostic. It requires Engineers who believe that solving customer problems quickly is what matters first; building scalable systems matters when customer problems are scaling problems. What youll do: 
Work in React Ruby Rails MongoDB and Postgres to solve problems for our customers.
Dive into all layers of the stack; frontend backend API data processors etc.
Jam with Product Managers Designers CS and other Engineers every day to shape the direction of our products.
Share your knowledge with people in Engineering; engineers should get better at their craft because they work with you. Even if you’re early in your career you have something to teach.
Contribute to the psychological safety of your team. Software is built by groups of people and good relationships matter. What you’ve accomplished: 
While we agree the interesting problems in Engineering are stack-agnostic we’d love it if you have experience with Ruby on Rails. We’ve found that Engineers with prior stack experience usually ramp faster.
You’ve worked for a startup before and are looking for a similar role. Or youve founded a company and are looking to get back into it.
You’ve been working as a professional Software Engineer for three or more years.
You understand SaaS business fundamentals (e.g. annual contract value customer acquisition cost and annual-recurring revenue) and can demonstrate how the work you’ve done influences these metrics. Compensation: 
Salary range: $136000-$230000 (This range incorporates multiple job levels)
Equity range: 0.08%-0.23%

Instead theyll become accountants because thats what dad did.What if that was different?Instead of growing up watching the adults they look up to doing stuff they hate what if they saw that there was a different way to do things?

What if they saw the adults in their lives excited engaged living fully alive? What gigantic problems could we solve then?

A random dude Tim Brown had the idea for them. And he had enough gumption and know-how to go out and actually make them. Now Allbirds is one of the most successful upstart shoe brands from the past 5 years.The world is a better place when every Tim out there turns their ideas into real-life products.Thats why our goal is to generate $100 million in revenue for our clients.

Were looking for engineers who care about the business and are excited to learn about customer needs and solve their problems.Love of learning and autonomy. Were an early stage company so there will be chaos despite our best efforts.

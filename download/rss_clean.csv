Here are a few concrete things that weve done lately and a few things on our short term roadmap to give you an idea of what kinds of things were up to and what you might do Integrating our internal calendar system to sync with Google Calendar and others Using our APM software to monitor and identify a bottleneck in a specific API endpoint and resolve it through various possible techniques Addressing a userreported bug in our React Native app where the keyboard when it was active was pushing some content outside of the accessible viewport Using Twilios Conversations API to create a fully custom integrated chat experience in our app for people on a project to talk with one another Adding the ability to drag and drop to rearrange items in a todo list Identifying an issue in an open source project we rely on fixing it and getting that fix approved and merged Adding in robust CSS3 and JavaScript animations to provide users with more finegrained and delightful UI feedback Spinning up a big net new feature behind a beta flag and slowly rolling it out to a test group and so much more Our team is small but growing and our roadmap is full of so much more than we could ever

quite comfortable with Rails andor React or something similar like Vue you know how to put things together and you can get things done Were looking for someone with experience creating and shipping software in a production environment and can show us or talk to us about it We dont do whiteboard interviews or algorithm lottery questions Instead we think the strongest indicator of whether you can do this type of work is whether you have successfully done this type of work before And for this role were going to ask you a lot about your past experience building products Our company is fully remote and has been since before COVID Our only current limitations on remote work are that you reside in the continental United States and mostly work during US time zones Were looking for someone who works and communicates well with others Building software is a collaborative process it requires a diverse team with different types of experts who all work together regularly and sometimes have to disagree and commit Teamwork like this is even more important in a distributed remote environment where effective collaboration is a bit more challenging Were looking for someone who has technical leadership experience or the strong desire to be in a technical leadership role To be considered youll need Staff Engineers at BuildBook play the role of technical leaders on our teams  we view them as mini CTOs The job is to know and grow a product or featureset as well as the small team of engineers that work on that project Technical leaders have the autonomy to make daytoday engineering decisions on their own but should also understand when to collaborate with other teams or reach out for help The job is to collaborate with their team to produce an amazing product and solve realworld problems for our customers Staff level technical leaders are still Individual Contributors and while they might be providing some amount of mentorship to their team they arent people managers and wont have direct reports They tend to lead through experience the results of which are seen in the amazing features and products their teams produce Theyre more of a maker than a manager Successful tech leads at BuildBook tend to be people who have a good bit of experience in building products from start to finish in a collaborative crossfunctional team environment Youre comfortable with a little ambiguity sometimes and can use your past experience to guide things from raw concepts to buildable products You understand that good engineering decisions are about finding the best path forward given the constraints youre working with Our requirements are somewhat flexible for this role as wed rather be as inclusive as possible As such the following are requirements At least 5 years of professional software development experience working in a team environment A successful Staff Engineer tends to have more experience than this though The ideal candidate will have 1 years of experience with some form of nonmanagerial technical leadership but were also willing to consider people looking to intentionally move into this type of role Experience with Ruby on Rails andor React OR experience in a similar tech stack and a willingness to learn Rails andor React Strong communication skills andor experience with remote work Residence in North America and the ability to work in a

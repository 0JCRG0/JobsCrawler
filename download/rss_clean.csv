"Product Design Manager, Cards",https://tryremotely.com/jobs/mercury-product-design-manager-cards-61153,"

 In 1954 Eero Saarinen designed a branch office with glass walls no offices and a completely open floor plan in Columbus Indiana. It was surrounded by trees; the furniture was made by Herman Miller; the lobby flooring was thick rustic brick. It was built with transparency and community at its core.  Since then a lot of things have happened—Saarinen’s branch is now a conference center people increasingly live on the internet and it’s hard to think of a single financial institution that still applies design thinking to their company. Mercury is on a mission to defy those expectations. We’re a financial technology company that helps startups spend less time banking* and more time building. We believe that the key to our success revolves around thoughtful design and we’re looking to add a design manager to our Cards Group.

You’ll be a key part of a team whose work is a cornerstone of Mercurys product strategy for 2023 and beyond.  Our design team consists of 30+ people who love to solve complex problems through design but are equally passionate about cultivating guiding and inspiring each other through their work to foster a collaborative environment of experimentation and innovation. *Mercury is a financial technology company not a bank.

Help us hire more great people.  There are a lot of paths that could lead you to a role like this so we encourage you to apply even if you’re not sure. Some relevant skills that can help:  You’ve led design teams of multiple sizes and have helped your designers grow in their careers.  You’ve worked in Fintech on spend or card-related projects or in other highly regulated industries such as healthcare.  You’re good at wrangling ambiguity and finding ways to improve the world around you even when nobody’s told you to do so.

You keep up on design trends and like to stay in practice even if it’s been awhile since you were an individual contributor.

Sr. Full Stack Engineer - Ruby on Rails and React JS,https://tryremotely.com/jobs/buildbook-sr-full-stack-engineer-ruby-on-rails-and-react-js-61098,"

 About the Job Our core technology is Ruby on Rails and ReactJS on the web along with a hybrid React Native mobile app.  You’ll be joining us in a period of rapid growth so your primary directive will be to roll up your sleeves and build stuff.   Our goal is for our product to be invisible to our users - it shouldn’t get in the way of their work it shouldn’t be confusing it shouldn’t require training.  That requires us to be very considerate of our experience very collaborative in how we build our software and very close to our customers through the sales and support process.   You’ll work closely with business design and customer support to craft the future of our product line and occasionally spin up wholly new products and codebases.  At a minimum you’ll need to be able to use your experience to work through ambiguity identify issues and offer suggestions.   Here are a few concrete things that we’ve done lately and a few things on our short term roadmap to give you an idea of what kinds of things we’re up to and what you might do:  Integrating our internal calendar system to sync with Google Calendar and others. Using our APM software to monitor and identify a bottleneck in a specific API endpoint and resolve it through various possible techniques. Addressing a user-reported bug in our React Native app where the keyboard when it was active was pushing some content outside of the accessible viewport. Using Twilio’s Conversations API to create a fully custom integrated chat experience in our app for people on a project to talk with one another. Adding the ability to drag and drop to rearrange items in a to-do list. Identifying an issue in an open source project we rely on fixing it and getting that fix approved and merged. Adding in robust CSS3 and JavaScript animations to provide users with more fine-grained and delightful UI feedback. Spinning up a big net new feature behind a beta flag and slowly rolling it out to a test group. ...and so much more.  Our team is small but growing and our roadmap is full of so much more than we could ever build right now.  In joining us you’ll have an outsized impact on the success of the product and company.  About You We’re looking for someone who is prolifically productive - which generally means you’re quite comfortable with Rails and/or React (or something similar like Vue) you know how to put things together and you can get things done.  We’re looking for someone with experience creating and shipping software in a production environment and can show us or talk to us about it.  We don’t do whiteboard interviews or algorithm lottery questions. Instead we think the strongest indicator of whether you can do this type of work is whether you have successfully done this type of work before.  And for this role we’re going to ask you a lot about your past experience building products. Our company is fully remote and has been since before COVID.  Our only current limitations on remote work are that you reside in the continental United States and mostly work during US time zones. We’re looking for someone who works and communicates well with others.  Building software is a collaborative process; it requires a diverse team with different types of experts who all work together regularly (and sometimes have to disagree and commit).  Teamwork like this is even more important in a distributed remote environment where effective collaboration is a bit more challenging. We’re looking for someone who has technical leadership experience or the strong desire to be in a technical leadership role.  To be considered you’ll need… Staff Engineers at BuildBook play the role of technical leaders on our teams - we view them as mini CTOs.  The job is to know and grow a product or featureset as well as the small team of engineers that work on that project.  Technical leaders have the autonomy to make day-to-day engineering decisions on their own but should also understand when to collaborate with other teams or reach out for help. The job is to collaborate with their team to produce an amazing product and solve real-world problems for our customers. Staff level technical leaders are still Individual Contributors and while they might be providing some amount of mentorship to their team they aren’t people managers and won’t have direct reports.  They tend to lead through experience the results of which are seen in the amazing features and products their teams produce.  They’re more of a maker than a manager. Successful tech leads at BuildBook tend to be people who have a good bit of experience in building products from start to finish in a collaborative cross-functional team environment.  You’re comfortable with a little ambiguity sometimes and can use your past experience to guide things from raw concepts to buildable products.  You understand that good engineering decisions are about finding the best path forward given the constraints you’re working with.  Our requirements are somewhat flexible for this role as we’d rather be as inclusive as possible. As such the following are requirements:  At least 5 years of professional software development experience working in a team environment.  A successful Staff Engineer tends to have more experience than this though. The ideal candidate will have 1+ years of experience with some form of non-managerial technical leadership but we’re also willing to consider people looking to intentionally move into this type of role. Experience with Ruby on Rails and/or React; OR experience in a similar tech stack and a willingness to learn Rails and/or React. Strong communication skills and/or experience with remote work. Residence in North America and the ability to work in a North American time zone.    Nice to have: BS in Computer Science Math EE or other applicable degrees.   Location Dependent InformationThis role is open to candidates and the expected salary range for this role is $150000-$165000. The specific salary for the successful candidate will be determined based on permissible non-discriminatory factors such as skills experience and geographic location. This role is also eligible to participate in Housecall Pro’s equity plan and the following benefits: health care insurance (medical dental vision disability) employee assistance program 401(K) flexible time off paid parental leave tech reimbursement and other company benefits. Housecall Pro is growing fast and we’re scaling our team to help enable and accelerate our growth. Privacy Notice for California Job Candidates - Housecall Pro

OpenPlay: Full Stack Ruby Engineer,https://weworkremotely.com/remote-jobs/openplay-full-stack-ruby-engineer,Time zones: EST (UTC -5)  CST (UTC -6)  MST (UTC -7)  PST (UTC -8)  AKST (UTC -9)  HST (UTC -10)Hello we’re OpenPlay! We make enterprise web applications for record labels (music industry)Looking for full-stack Ruby engineers (Rails-like or Python/Django + want to learn Ruby)Would like 2 or more years of professional web development experiencePositions are full time fully remote and/or we have an office in Los AngelesStarting salary 100-150k (depending on experience) + benefitsWe’re hiring full-stack Ruby software engineers to work with us on our suite of enterprise web-based music industry apps. You’ll work with us to architect build deploy and maintain applications used by the world’s largest record companies (and some of the world’s smallest). This is a full-time position that can be in our office (Los Angeles/Santa Monica) or fully remote (US only at this time). We are looking for engineers with two or more years of full stack web application development experience. Starting salary range is 100-150k depending on experience. Learn more about OpenPlay at: www.openplay.coEngineering at OpenPlayThousands of record labels around the world use our flagship product OpenPlay Music to manage and distribute their music. We work with the major US record distributors and many independents. We are onboarding another 300+ record labels this year and we need to grow our engineering team to handle increasing demand for both client services and new product growth. OpenPlay is a bootstrapped growing company started in 2013.In your role at OpenPlay you will be collaborating with a team of 4-6 other engineers and a UX/visual designer to design build review deploy maintain and iterate on OpenPlay’s web applications. We follow a minimal agile process focused on rapid deployment and incremental improvement. Engineers participate in a weekly planning meeting a daily engineering meeting choose what to work on and then spend the rest of their time getting their work done collaborating as needed.You will share the same responsibilities as the rest of your engineering team which include:Participating in a weekly planning meeting where we review our goals and prioritize work to be done for the coming week.Participating in daily engineering-only meetings (roughly 30min) where the team collaborates on technical decisions resolving issues and reducing complexity.Writing tests: we write mostly full-stack integration tests and use a single testing framework for all parts of the code.Writing application code: mostly Ruby some HTML some Javascript. CSS is mostly handled by visual design.Reviewing code: We do round-robin code reviews as a means of knowledge sharing. All pull requests are reviewed by another engineer. You’ll take turns reviewing everyone else’s code and they will take turns reviewing yours.Deploying code: We deploy small changes to production code multiple times per day. Deployments are automated with lots of fail-safes and we rely on third party services for devops as much as possible.Maintaining code: Maintenance is a part of all code changes but we also plan specifically for improving code quality and updating to newer conventions techniques and technologies. You will also be reproducing and fixing the occasional bug.Some things you won’t do:Estimating work to be done. Instead we try to break work down into small enough chunks that they can be done quickly.Reporting progress. Work is done when it’s deployed. Instead we try to reduce the scope of work that is growing complex.Stakeholder meetings. While agile processes are all about open channels of communication we find too much can be overwhelming. We have technical product managers who work with stakeholders instead allowing everyone else to focus on their work while getting their questions answered.As a small company with a flat management structure there are lots of opportunities for everyone to make an impact not only on our products but also on how we build them. We apply the same methodology of incremental improvement to our code as we do to our tools processes and conventions. You will be able to participate in these discussions as much as you like and we would like to learn from your experience but the degree to which you participate is up to you.Experience we’re looking forThe main thing we’re looking for is experience in full stack web application development. Specifically we think you’ll need at least two years experience working on all parts of a database-centric web application to be a productive member of your team. In particular you should have experience with:Relational database concepts such as: foreign keys indexes normalization and denormalization SQL queries.Writing Ruby code in an MVC web framework. We don’t use Rails but we follow many of the same conventions. We’ve had success bringing people on from Python/Django so if you have Python experience and would like to learn Ruby it might be a good fit.Some familiarity with Javascript. We push as much behavior as possible to the server but features often do have small client-side components.Writing tests. We practice integration-test-heavy outside-in test-driven development. If you’ve practiced any sort of test-driven development you will pick it up fast.In addition to being able to get things done we are also looking for someone who can research and implement best practices in order to get things done well. Code smells and poor architectural decisions can slow everyone down and make everyone sad. We collaborate frequently and we don’t always get things right on the first try but we are looking for people who will do the work to build things well to reduce the maintenance burden for themselves and their team.Technologies we useOpenPlay Music is a monolithic application backed by a PostgreSQL relational database. Heavy operations are processed asynchronously by scalable background workers that notify clients via WebSockets. At present we have plenty of room to scale.Our server-side code is MVC-structured and built on Sequel (ORM) Sinatra and HAML. If you’re familiar with Rails (or similar MVC frameworks) you’ll find a lot of similarities and many of the same conventions here.On the client side we use StimulusJS to apply bits of dynamic behavior where it improves the user experience most of which ultimately requests updates from the server.There are currently around 2500 full-stack browser-based integration tests covering every feature from user input to expected output. CI runs on every git push and completes in about 15 minutes.We do things typical of web applications like:Store data in and query from a relational database (PostgreSQL)Index data and query it with filtering and full text searching (Elasticsearch)Handle slow tasks with background processingPush asynchronous updates to clients with WebSocketsExport XML files PDFs CSVs Excel spreadsheets and other formats that just won’t seem to go awayImport data from Excel spreadsheets (music-industry standard) DDEX XML JSON and various other sourcesCommunicate with lots of external systems across all manner of bespoke APIsProvide JSON APIs for our customers to build on top ofUse git for version control build features in branches and take turns reviewing pull requestsRun everything on cloud infrastructureRely on service providers for devops as much as possible (Heroku etc)Some benefits of working at OpenPlayStarting salary 100-155k depending on experienceMedical dental and vision insuranceWhatever tools services books etc you need to do your jobLow stress environment: The industry we’re in is comparatively low scale and high value. While we work with lots of data we avoid some of the technical issues and constant urgency you might find with consumer applications.Good work/life balance: We expect that everyone works full time (40 hours/week). We do sometimes have deadlines and we haven’t always limited scope appropriately. The last time we worked late nights was in 2019 for about a week. The time before that was in 2016 for about 3 weeks. Our most recent deadline we met two weeks early.Flexible work and vacation schedule. You are free to work the hours that work best for you (outside of our scheduled meetings) and we don’t have a set limit on vacation days.Free to work remote. We’ve been doing remote work as long as we’ve been around and our process is built around it. Some of our team is permanently remote others work out of the office part time.Office near the beach in Santa Monica you can use any time.Free lunch at nearby restaurants when you’re in the office. Some of which are delicious.How to applySend us your resume! Include a cover letter to add additional details and context if you feel so inclined. We’re mostly looking for two things:Prior work experience that looks like it might be a good match for what you’ll be doing at OpenPlay.Some understanding of how to program well. Maybe a computer science degree or other academic background. Code contributions you can point to. Blog articles you wrote. A particularly enlightening reddit comment.We’d love to know a bit about you as well but it can be a challenging prospect for an initial job application. Feel free to include anything else you’d like but don’t worry too much about it we’re mostly looking for the above qualifications at this point.We look forward to hearing from you good luck on your job search wherever it leads and thank  you for considering joining OpenPlay!,2023-12-08,USA Only,2023-12-08 19:37:19.082026
